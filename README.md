# Real Time Collaborative Whiteboard (Frontend Only)

A **real-time collaborative whiteboard** built using **React**, designed to showcase strong frontend fundamentals such as state management, drag-and-drop interactions, controlled inputs, and real-time synchronization **without a backend**.

## Features

- Create sticky notes with custom text
- Each note gets a unique pastel color (HSL-based)
- Edit notes inline
- Delete notes
- Drag & drop notes freely
- Notes are constrained within the viewport (`vw` / `vh`)
- Data persistence using `localStorage`
- Real-time sync across browser tabs using `BroadcastChannel`
- Responsive full-screen whiteboard

---

## Tech Stack

- **React (JavaScript)**
- **React Hooks**
- **React Query**
- **CSS**
- **localStorage**
- **BroadcastChannel API**

> ❌ No backend  
> ❌ No database  
> ❌ No WebSockets

This project intentionally focuses on **frontend-only architecture**.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### Controlled Inputs

All inputs (add/edit note) use controlled components with React state.

### Immutable State Updates

Notes are updated immutably to ensure predictable re-renders.

### Drag & Drop Logic

- Calculates cursor offset on drag start
- Converts viewport coordinates to canvas-relative positions
- Clamps note position to screen boundaries

### Real-Time Collaboration (Frontend Only)

Uses the **BroadcastChannel API** to sync state changes across multiple browser tabs — simulating multi-user collaboration without a backend.

### Persistence

All board data is saved to `localStorage`, ensuring data survives refreshes.

---

## Real-Time Sync Explained

When a note is added, edited, moved, or deleted:

1. The board state updates locally
2. Changes are saved to `localStorage`
3. Updates are broadcast to other open tabs
4. Other tabs receive and apply the update instantly

---

## Getting Started

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/venugopalsp95/whiteboard.git

npm install

npm run dev
```

---

## How to Test Real-Time Sync

1. Open the app in **two browser tabs**
2. Add / edit / drag a note in one tab
3. Changes instantly appear in the other tab

---

## 📌 Future Improvements (Optional)

- User-based cursors
- Zoom & pan
- Touch support
- Backend integration
- Undo / redo
- Color picker per note
